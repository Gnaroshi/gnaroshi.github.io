        We are working on a range of challenges in the realm of machine
        learning, concentrating in particular on computer vision releated
        problems. Our research incldues the development of large-scale vision
        models and exploring multimodal approaches that integrate vision with
        language and speech modalities. We apply these models to investigate
        real-world challenges across diverse domains, including industrial and
        medical data.
